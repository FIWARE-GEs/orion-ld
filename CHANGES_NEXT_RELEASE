- Hardening: Mongo driver now compiled using --use-sasl-client --ssl to enable proper DB authentication mechanisms
- Fix: correct error payload using errorCode (previously orionError was used) in POST /v1/queryContext and POST /v1/updateContext in some cases
- Hardening: modification of the URL parsing mechanism, making it more efficient, and the source code easier to follow
